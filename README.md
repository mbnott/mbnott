# ME!!
## Who?
Hello, i'm mbnot. I'm currently in an apprenticeship in switzerland, so i can become a software developer.  
I can talk both french and english.  
I have a bit of experience in C#, as well as PHP. I also have an interest in learning RUST.
<!--## Why?
The main reasons that made me want to discover the world of IT, particularly programming, are problem solving and creation.  
Problem solving and logical analysis usually require a lot of thinking, and are very prevalent in IT. Lucky me, as for some reason i can spend hours doing just this.  
Making things that i simpy thought about become reality is also something that i've always dreamt of. Programming allows me to do that! Doing it efficiently is another story though. 
-->
## What?
My goal is to learn as much as possible about all there is to know about programming, to become a great dev.  
I would also love contributing to open source, however i am not exactly confident in my programming skills at the moment.
## Where?
You can contact me on discord: `mbnot`
